# Restart the Hive Gateway

Stops and restarts the Python `gateway` process bound to ports 8766 (loopback + Tailscale `100.x`). Leaves the Terry voice/image bot and Scout watchdog running.

## How to do it

```bash
# 1. Find the gateway PID
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq python.exe" /V 2>&1 | grep -i gateway

# 2. Kill it (replace <PID>)
taskkill /F /PID <PID>

# 3. Restart in background, redirect stderr+stdout to log
cd "/c/Projects/Ai-Team" && \
  nohup python -m gateway > /c/tmp/ai-team/gateway.log 2> /c/tmp/ai-team/gateway.log.err &
```

Or, use the full PowerShell launcher (starts gateway + Terry + Scout; idempotent — skips already-running processes):

```bash
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "./hive\scripts\start-all.ps1"
```

## How to verify it came up

Wait ~3 seconds, then check the tail of `C:\tmp\ai-team\gateway.log.err`:

```bash
tail -15 /c/tmp/ai-team/gateway.log.err
```

Expect:
- `gateway.app: skill registry loaded: ...`
- `gateway.app: hive coordinator built with N helpers`
- `gateway.app: image catalog loaded (...)`
- `gateway.app: gateway ready with bots: terry`
- `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8766`
- `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8766`

If you don't see the last two lines, the gateway didn't bind properly.

## Common failure modes

- **`Address already in use`** → old process didn't die. `netstat -ano | findstr :8766` to find the lingerer, `taskkill /F /PID <PID>`.
- **Crashes on import** → usually a Python syntax error in the code you just changed. Check the first lines of `gateway.log.err`.
- **Lifespan hangs** → vault_writer daemon didn't come up. Check if it's running: `tasklist | grep vault_writer` and look at `C:\tmp\ai-team\vault_writer.log`.

## Don't restart unnecessarily

Most code changes don't need a restart — the gateway hot-reloads on file changes if you ran it with `--reload`. Restart only when:
- you changed lifespan / startup code
- you changed config files
- you're chasing a state-corruption bug
